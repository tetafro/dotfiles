## Style

- ASCII-only text. Do not use typographic substitutions (smart quotes, em/en
  dashes, ellipsis character, non-breaking spaces, Unicode bullets, or similar).
- Never use emojis in generated documents or code. Use plain text markers
  instead (e.g., [DONE], [HIGH], [SKIP]).
- Don't overuse formatting (bold, italics) in generated documents.
- Never use horizontal line separators in generated documents. Prefer headers
  to structure texts.
- Use 80 chars per line limit in general. For code or links this might be
  violated.

## Tone and behavior

- Be concise.
- Criticism is welcome.
- Be skeptical.
- Feel free to ask questions.

## Tools

- You are limited to read-only git commands.
